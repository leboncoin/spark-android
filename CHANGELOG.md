### Spark

#### Animations

##### 🆕 Add new `pulse` modifier animation

This animation display a pulsating wave from the component to catch the attention of the user eyes.
THe color, scales, duration and shape are customizable.
```kotlin
ButtonTinted(
    modifier = Modifier
        .pulse(
            shape = SparkTheme.shapes.large,
        ),
    text = "Vibing",
)
```

##### 🆕 Add new `shake` modifier animation

This animation display a transformative animations using a spring animation spec.
It's ideal to indicate validation on user interaction.
```kotlin
 val vibrateController = rememberShakeController()

ButtonTinted(
    modifier = Modifier.shake(vibrateController),
    onClick = {
        vibrateController.shake(
            ShakeConfig(
                iterations = 8,
                intensity = 100_000f,
                translateX = -15f,
            ),
        )
    },
    text = "Vibrate me",
)
```

- 🆕 Add a `pulse` example and configurator
- Pulse now have a `enabled` argument to avoid making a complex modifier chain when we want to control the visibility of this animation

#### Popover

- 🔧 Add a `positionProvider` argument to change the spacing between a `Popover` and its anchor

#### Modal

- 🐛 Fixed ModalScaffold by removing `FLAG_LAYOUT_NO_LIMITS` window flag to allow proper scrollable popup behavior when it's used inside it

#### Checkbox, RadioButton & Switch: API changes

- The `intent` parameter for `Checkbox`, `RadioButton`, and `Switch` is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. We are keeping only the "Basic" and "Error" colors to ensure better visual consistency.
- Use the new `error: Boolean` parameter to indicate error/validation state for `Checkbox` & `RadioButton` components.
- The `ContentSide` parameter will be deprecated in a future release to improve readability and accessibility (a11y). All content will be aligned to the right/end by default for better screen reader support.

> [!CAUTION]
> - If you use a color other than **"Basic"** or **"Error"**, consider replacing it and use the new `error` parameter.
> - If you use Start/left content side, update your usage to End/right alignment for improved accessibility.

### Spark

#### 🆕 High Color Contrast Support
> [!NOTE]
> This feature requires Android 14 (API level 34) or higher to access system contrast settings.

- ✨ High contrast color themes are now available for both light and dark modes

Call these new methods to get the basic colors in high contrast for light and dark mode:
```kotlin
if (useDarkColors) {
    darkHighContrastSparkColors()
} else {
    lightHighContrastSparkColors()
}
```

#### 🆕 ComboBox Component
> [!TIP]
> ComboBox uses the new TextFieldState API for improved state management.

- ✨ **Major API Upgrade**: ComboBox components now use `TextFieldState` instead of value/onValueChange pattern (#1572)
- ✨ **Enhanced Single Selection**: `SingleChoiceComboBox` with improved filtering and suggestion capabilities
- ✨ **Multi-Selection Support**: `MultiChoiceComboBox` with chip-based selection display and management

**Example: Real-time Filtering ComboBox**
```kotlin
val state = rememberTextFieldState()
var expanded by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
var searchText by remember { mutableStateOf("") }

val filteredBooks by remember(searchText) {
    derivedStateOf {
        if (searchText.isBlank()) comboBoxSampleValues
        else comboBoxSampleValues.filter {
            it.title.contains(searchText, ignoreCase = true)
        }
    }
}

LaunchedEffect(Unit) {
    snapshotFlow { state.text }
        .debounce(300.milliseconds)
        .onEach { queryText -> searchText = queryText.toString() }
        .collect()
}

SingleChoiceComboBox(
    state = state,
    expanded = expanded,
    onExpandedChange = { expanded = it },
    onDismissRequest = { expanded = false },
    label = "Search books",
    placeholder = "Type to search...",
    helper = "Filter books by typing in the search box"
) {
    filteredBooks.forEach { book ->
        DropdownMenuItem(
            text = { Text(book.title) },
            onClick = {
                state.setTextAndPlaceCursorAtEnd(book.title)
                expanded = false
            },
            selected = book.title == state.text
        )
    }
}
```

**Example: Smart Suggestions ComboBox**
```kotlin
val state = rememberTextFieldState()
var searchText by remember { mutableStateOf("") }

val suggestedBooks by remember(searchText) {
    derivedStateOf {
        if (searchText.isBlank()) emptyList()
        else comboBoxSampleValues.filter {
            it.title.contains(searchText, ignoreCase = true)
        }.take(3) // Limit to top 3 suggestions
    }
}

var showDropdown by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
val expanded by remember {
    derivedStateOf { showDropdown && suggestedBooks.isNotEmpty() }
}

SingleChoiceComboBox(
    state = state,
    expanded = expanded,
    onExpandedChange = { showDropdown = it },
    onDismissRequest = {
        searchText = ""
        showDropdown = false
    },
    label = "Search with suggestions",
    placeholder = "Type to see suggestions...",
    helper = "Get book suggestions as you type"
) {
    suggestedBooks.forEach { book ->
        DropdownMenuItem(
            text = { Text(book.title) },
            onClick = {
                state.setTextAndPlaceCursorAtEnd(book.title)
                searchText = ""
                showDropdown = false
            },
            selected = book.title == state.text
        )
    }
}
```
